# npm-download-service

An HTTP service that resolves all transitive npm dependencies from a `package.json` and packages them as a self-contained `.tgz` archive for offline installation. Useful for air-gapped environments, dependency snapshots, and supply chain audits.

## API endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check; returns `{ status, timestamp }` |
| `POST` | `/upload` | Upload a `package.json` body; returns `{ id }` |
| `GET` | `/files` | List all uploaded files with metadata |
| `GET` | `/files?showToday=true` | List only files uploaded today (local time) |
| `POST` | `/jobs` | Start a download job; body `{ id }`; returns 202 immediately |

## Typical workflow

**1. Upload a `package.json`:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/upload \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @my-project.json
# → { "id": "20260321-1000-<uuid>" }
```

**2. Trigger a download job:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/jobs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{ "id": "20260321-1000-<uuid>" }'
# → 202 Accepted; job runs in the background
```

**3. Collect output** — the `.tgz` archive appears in `output/<id>.tgz` when the job completes.

## Input format

A standard `package.json` with any combination of `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and/or `peerDependencies`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "lodash": "^4.17.21"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

All three sections are merged and fully resolved before downloading. For peer dependencies, any version spec containing `||` or comparison operators (`>=`, `>`, etc.) is resolved to the latest matching concrete version. Simple peer dep ranges (`^`, `~`, exact) are passed through as-is. Peer deps already present in `dependencies`/`devDependencies` are not duplicated.

Only the fields `name`, `version`, `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` are saved — any other fields in the uploaded body are stripped before writing to disk.

### Validation

| Condition | Status | Error |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Body is not a JSON object | `400` | `"Request body must be a JSON object"` |
| None of the three dep fields are present | `422` | `"package.json must contain at least one of: dependencies, devDependencies, peerDependencies"` |
| A dep field is not an object | `422` | `"\"<field>\" must be an object"` |
| A dep field contains a non-string value | `422` | `"All values in \"<field>\" must be strings"` |

The request body is capped at 100 KB by the HTTP server.

## Output format

Each `output/<id>.tgz` contains:

```
<id>.tgz
├── metadata.json
├── express-4.18.2.tgz
├── lodash-4.17.21.tgz
└── ... (all transitive dependencies)
```

### metadata.json

```json
{
  "startedAt": "2026-03-21T10:00:00+09:00",
  "completedAt": "2026-03-21T10:02:34+09:00",
  "summary": { "total": 120, "succeeded": 118, "failed": 2 },
  "audit": {
    "severities": { "info": 0, "low": 3, "moderate": 8, "high": 2, "critical": 1, "total": 14 },
    "highPackages": [{ "name": "semver", "version": "6.3.0" }],
    "criticalPackages": [{ "name": "lodash", "version": "4.17.15" }]
  },
  "packages": [{ "name": "express", "version": "4.18.2", "tarball": "express-4.18.2.tgz" }],
  "failedPackages": [{ "name": "some-private-pkg", "version": "1.0.0", "error": "E404 Not Found" }]
}
```

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm start       # starts on SERVER_PORT (default 3000)
```

Requires a `.env` file — copy `.env.template` and set `SERVER_PORT` if needed.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Start HTTP server (no build step required) |
| `npm run dev` | Start with file watching |
| `npm run build` | Compile TypeScript to `dist/` |

## How it works

1. **Upload** — `POST /upload` validates the body (object shape, at least one dep field, string values only), strips extra fields, saves to `input/<id>.json`, and returns the ID
2. **Trigger** — `POST /jobs` starts a background job for that ID; responds 202 immediately
3. **Resolve** — merges `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` (resolving complex peer dep version ranges to concrete versions via `semver`), writes a merged `package.json` to a temp directory, and runs `npm install --ignore-scripts` to materialise the full dependency tree
4. **Audit** — runs `npm audit --json` against the installed lock file and extracts vulnerability counts and HIGH/CRITICAL package names
5. **Download** — runs `npm pack <name>@<version>` for every resolved package and collects the `.tgz` files
6. **Package** — bundles all tarballs together with `metadata.json` into `output/<id>.tgz`
7. **Cleanup** — removes the temp directory
